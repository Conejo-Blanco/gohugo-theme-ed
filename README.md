# Ed

Ed is a [Hugo][hugo] theme designed for textual editors based on
[minimal computing][mincomp] principles, and focused on legibility, durability,
ease and flexibility.

This theme is adopted and finalized with new functionality from
[Jekyll][jekyll] [Ed][ed-original] theme by [Alex Gil][gil-twitter].

## Introduction

One of our most pressing and ever-evolving needs as scholars is to
pass on our textual artifacts from one generation to another. The art of
textual editing, among otherpractices, has helped many cultures to remember
and interpret for centuries. Alas, that art is practiced and encouraged in its
highest form by a dwindling number of scholars. In a digital environment the
problem is compounded by the difficulties of the medium. While vast
repositories and "e-publications" appear on the online scene yearly, very few
manifest a textual scholar's disciplined attention to detail. In contrast, most
textual scholars who have made the leap to a rigorous digital practice have
focused on markup, relying on technical teams to deploy and maintain their
work. This makes your average scholarly digital edition a very costly and
therefore limited affair.

As we see it, a minimal edition is one that aims to reduce the size and
complexity of the back and front end while flattening the learning curves for
the user and the producer. Out of the box, the Ed theme can help you build a
simple reading edition, or a traditional scholarly edition with footnotes and
a bibliography, without breaking the bank. In our estimate, these are the two
most immediately useful type of editions for editors and readers. An edition
produced with Ed consists of static pages whose rate of decay is substantially
lower than database-driven systems. As an added bonus, these static pages
require less bandwidth. Our hope is that our approach can help beginners and
veterans deploy beautiful editions with less effort, and that it can help us
teach a 'full stack' [in one academic semester][minimal-editions], while
allowing us to care for our projects at less cost, and perhaps, just perhaps,
to generate high-quality editions on github.io in large quantities based on the
[git-lit][git-lit] model by Jonathan Reeve. We're coming for you, Kindle!
