This is an example of a custom shortcode that you can put right into your content.
You will need to add a form action to the the shortcode to make it work.
Check out [Formspark](https://formspark.io/) for a simple, free form service.

Ed theme is not strictly tied to any forms backend. You can easily use any backend
like [Formspark](https://formspark.io/), [Formspree](https://formspree.io/),
[FabForm](https://fabform.io) and so on just by changing the `formAction` parameter
in the site configuration file.

For a more subtle configuration of the contact form itself, you can also replace
`layouts/shortcodes/form-contact.html` partial in project wide level.

{{< form-contact >}}
