# hi.

Ed is a <a href="http://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a> theme designed for textual
editors based on <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/" target="_blank">minimal computing principles</a>,
and focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. Our underlying technology is easy to
learn and teach, and can produce beautifully rendered scholarly or reading editions of texts meant
to last. To start using Ed, please see [our documentation]({{< ref "/documentation" >}}) for installation
instructions and more. To learn more about the ideas behind Ed and a list of current features
see our [about]({{< ref "/about" >}}) section. To see Ed in action, we've provided some sample minimal editions
for you below.
